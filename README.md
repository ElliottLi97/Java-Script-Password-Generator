# Java-Script-Password-Generator
Here is my password generator. It can create a random password anywhere from 8 to 128 characters long using character sets of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. The user can customize the length and characters through a set of on screen prompts. 

The site was created using some prewritten html and css code and my own javascript code. 

The finished site can be found here [Here](https://elliottli97.github.io/Java-Script-Password-Generator/)
